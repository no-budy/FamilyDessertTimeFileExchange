# Family Dessert Time File Exchange!
## This is also using an OSU library from school which you can find [here](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/common/doc/)

### Usage:
1. Edit the src/GetterController1.java file to correspond with the server and creditials. (I will do key files later)
2. Build with the OSU library that I have linked.
